# Dependency notations replacements and removals

Must be done at init time (in `settingsEvaluated { ‚Ä¶ }`) because it shall happen before build files are compiled and evaluated.

## How to detect removal?

Tests checking for no removal would instead populate the new file for removed dependency notations.

### Where should these be put it given versioning constraints?

Do we need to parse our own version?

Or should keep something analogue to Android app's `versionCode`?
Can this be fully be automated?
If the VersionsPropertiesModel doesn't keep that value, can we use an internal map for the matching versions, when there's a match, in a way that would also work for snapshots, or disregard unexpected suffixes?

## How to detect

## Implementation path

### Any migration to make?

In `bootstrapRefreshVersionsCore`, figure out efficiently if refreshVersions has just been updated.

### Doing the migration

#### ‚úÖüßê Required data:

An ordered list (oldest to newest) with the following data for all removals since last upgrade:
- dependency notation
- corresponding dependency notation
- reason of removal
  - Usually deprecation, with direct replacement or not.
  - coordinates of replacement, if any
  - info url, if any
  - actionable info for a TODO comment?

#### ‚úÖ Removed dependency notations storage/file-format

```markdown
## Revision 1

~~AndroidX.wear.watchFace.client~~
//
moved:[androidx.wear.watchface..watchface-client]
id:[androidx.wear..wear-watchface-client]

## Revision 2
~~SomeGroup.something~~
id:[com.somegroup..somegroup-something]
```

#### Tests update

Removed dependency notations shall be removed from the `dependencies-mapping-validated.txt` file to avoid clash when the
maven coordinates stay the same, but the dependency notation moves.

The list of removed dependency notations should be prefilled, but
the tests should fail until there's been manual edit and validation.

#### Migration operation:

Keep in mind it shall:
- Honor the `withVersion(‚Ä¶)`, `withoutVersion()` and others when rewriting.
- Not be able to break the build.
- Let the user know about the rewrite via a warning log.

#### ‚úÖ Example results

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // SomeGroup.something has been replaced,
    // following the deprecation of the com.somegroup:somegroup-something artifact
    //FIXME: Replace with the new dependency and remove these comments.
    // d
    api("com.somegroup:somegroup-something:_")
//moved:SomeGroup.somethingElse)
}
```
